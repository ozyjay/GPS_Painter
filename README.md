# GPS_Painter

This is the Android implementation of my GPS Painter app from the Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.crunchycodes.gpspainter&hl=en

The idea is that you move around outside in the sun, soak up some much needed Vitamin D, and draw your favourite pixel art :)

The app works by using your mobile's GPS location data to track your movement outside.
